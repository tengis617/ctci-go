# VII Technical Questions

## How to Prepare
For every problem in this book:
1. Try to solve the problem on your own. Push yourself.
2. Write on paper. Get used to it.
3. Test your code on paper.
4. Type your paper code and compile. Take notes of mistakes you make so you can improve.

## What You need to know
Baseline Knowledge:
1. Core Data Structures, Algorithms, and Concepts
   1. Data Structures
      1. Linked Lists
      2. Trees, Tries, & Graphs
      3. Stacks & Queues
      4. Heaps
      5. Vectors / ArrayLists
      6. Hashtables
   2. Algoritms
      1. Breadth-First Search
      2. Depth-First Search
      3. Binary Search
      4. Merge Sort
      5. Quick Sort
   3. Concepts
      1. Bit Manipulation
      2. Memory(Stack vs. Heap)
      3. Recursion
      4. Dynamic Programming
      5. Big O Time & Space
2. [Powers of 2 Table](https://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/computer/powers-of-2.htm)

## Walking Through a Problem
1. Listen Carefully. Pay close attention and make mental notes of unique information.
2. Draw an example. A good Example has to be specific (real numbers, strings), sufficiently large, and not be a special case.
3. State a brute force. No matter how bad, its a good starting point. Explain the space & time complexity.
4. Optimize.
   1. Look for any unused information.
   2. Use a fresh example.
   3. Solve it "incorrectly".
   4. Make time vs. space tradeoff.
   5. Precompute information.
   6. Use a hash table.
   7. Think about the best conceivable time.
5. Walk Through. Take a moment to solidify your understanding of the algorithm.
6. Implement
   1. Modularize code.
   2. Error checks.
   3. Use other classes/structs where appropriate.
   4. Good variable names.
7. Test
   1. Start with a conceptual test. Read and analyze each line of code.
   2. Double check weird looking code.
   3. Check for hot spots.
   4. Test small test cases.
   5. Test special cases.
