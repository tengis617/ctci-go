# Chapter 1: The Interview Process

Most tech companies evaluate problem solving skills by assigning algorithmic problems you haven't seen before. The key is not really to be able to solve multiple (or even one) problem, and the interviewer will asses your performance based on the following:
1. Analytical Skills
2. Coding Skills
3. Technical Knowledge / Computer Science Fundamentals
4. Experience
5. Cluture fit/ Communication skills


## Why?
Coding interviews seem unnecessary since it does not reflect how you will be actually working, but the following are the reasons its used from the interviewer's perspective:
- False negatives are acceptable. Companies are more concerned with false positives.
- Problem solving skills are valuable.
- Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful.
- Whiteboards let you focus on what matters. You don't have to worry about coding itself, but rather focus on the big picture.
- But it's not for everyone or every company or every situation. Its not perfect, but its reasonable enough for some companies.

## How Questions are selected
It all depends on the interviewer and there is no definitive list of questions that are asked and won't differ over the years, or between companies. Some companies tend to focus more on the algoritm part, whereas some emphasize knowledge-based questions.

## It's all Relative
Assessment is based on how you do relative to other candidates on the same question and same interviewer. Getting a hard question is not necessarily bad for you, since it probably was relatively hard for other candidates as well.
